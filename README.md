# Code_Demo

This repository contains a simple demo showcasing how to deploy a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Streamlit.

Overview
The purpose of this demo is to illustrate how easy it is to use Streamlit to create web applications for machine learning models. In this example, we deploy a CNN model to classify images.

Files
Code_demo.py: The main Streamlit application script.
cnn_model2.pth: The pre-trained CNN model file.
requirements.txt: The list of dependencies required to run the application.
README.md: This file.
